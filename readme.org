* What
  This is my First Kotlin app for android, following the tutorial at
  https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app-kotlin/,
  That simple application just keeps some counters and passes those
  around through a couple of views.

* Why
  Getting familiar with kotlin and the whole Android framework and
  toolchain.

* When
  A weekend on Oct 2019

* Who
